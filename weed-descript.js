    cultural: 'Chickweed is common throughout the world, where it can be found in lawns, cultivation, orchards \
    nurseries, waste places and fields. \
    Chickweed is often an annual in cooler climates, while becoming perennial in warmer zones. The slender stems have a spreading \
    growth habit and can reach up to 40 cm. Plants are sparsely hairy and a distinguishing feature \
    is one line of fine hairs on the stem. Plants have small white flowers. A single plant can produce a few thousand seeds, \
    which are reported to remain viable in the soil for 25-40 years. \
    Even in cooler climates, several generations are produced per year. Plants can reach flowering after only 5 weeks \
    in some conditions. Chickweed is capable of self and cross pollination. \
    Chickweed will tolerate a range of soil conditions, but thrives in moist soil where nitrogen is \
    plentiful.',
    hosts: 'The nectar and pollen of the flowers attract primarily small bees and flies, while less common floral visitors include \
    nectar-seeking butterflies and parasitoid wasps (Illinois Wildflowers). \

    <em>Cassida flaveola</em> (Pale Tortoise Beetle), <em>Abstrusomyzus phloxae</em> (Aphids), <em>Coleophora coenosipennella</em> \

    cultural: 'Flickweed or Hairy Bittercress is a common weed of damp areas, recently disturbed soil, open ground, \
    gardens, turf, cultivation, nurseries and wasteplaces. It is particularly prevalent in nurseries. The common name, \
    Flickweed, refers to the rapid release of the seed when ripe. Due to structural features, often the slightest touch or wind triggers \
    the release of the seed. Seed move in all directions and travel some distance (up to a metre). \
    The botanical term is called ballochory, which is a type of rapid plant movement. Many people in the nursery industry \
    also know that the seeds can sometimes come in contact with eyes, which results in irritation. \
    Flickweed seed can remain viable in the soil or potting for several years. \
    Following germination, flickweed can reach maturity within five weeks if conditions are suitable. \
    Flickweed is a lender annual to 30 cm high, branched, sparsely hirsute (thick covering of stiff hairs). \
    Flowers are small and white, with the siliqua (a dry dehiscent fruit) 15–25 mm long containing the seeds. \
    ',
    hosts: 'The small white flowers are known to attract bees and butterflies. \
    Flickweed is a known host for whiteflies, mites, and some diseases. \
    The caterpillars of the butterfly <em>Anthocharis midea</em> (Falcate Orangetip) and the moth \
    <em>Evergestis pallidata</em> (Purple-Backed Cabbageworm) are reported to feed on flickweed. \
    It is also a source of nectar (adult) and host plant (larvae) of the cabbage white butterfly (<em>Pieris napi</em>).',

    vegetable crops, such as beetroot and silverbeet. \
    It is a common weed in gardens, horticulture, agriculture, orchards and waste areas. \
    Fat hen thrives in well drained cultivated soils, however it tolerates a wide range of soil types \
    and conditions. Fat hen is a large leafy annual up to 2.5 m high. Lower leaves rhombic (2-dimensional diamond-shaped figure) to \
    ovate, grading into elliptic (oval) to linear (narrow) up the stem. \
    The small flowers are radially symmetrical and grow in small cymes on a dense branched inflorescence 10–40 cm long. \
    Plants produce both dormant and ready to germinate seeds, with approximate seed quantities ranging from 200 to \
    75,000 seeds per plant. Dormant seed can remain viable in the soil for decades. \
    Allelopathic effects (reduced growth) have been reported for a number of important crops, such as maize, soyabeans, \
    carrots, cucumbers, onions, tomatoes, sunflowers, lettuce and squash. Fat hen is also resistant to multiple herbicides.',
    hosts: 'Fat hen is apparently attractive to leaf miners and is used as a trap crop for this purpose. \
    It is also a host plant for the beet leafhopper, an insect \
    which transmits curly top virus to beet crops. Aphids are also attracted to fat hen. \
    Fat hen is a known host of viruses, some of which include cucumber mosaic virus, bean yellow mosaic virus, potato virus, \
    tobacco etch virus, turnip mosaic virus, beet necrotic yellow vein virus (BNYVV),  peanut stunt cucumovirus, \
    prunus necrotic ring spot virus, beet yellows virus (BYV) and watermelon mosaic virus. BYV is reported to be transmitted by <em>Myzus persicae</em> \
    (Green peach aphid). Nematodes include northern root-knot (<em>nematode Meloidogyne halpa</em> and \
    potato root-knot nematode (<em>Ditylenchus destructor</em>). \

    uses: 'Medicinal and edible uses are reported.',
    cultural: 'Wild radish is annual plant, with germination and growth occurring in the cooler months of the year. \
    In the early stages of growth, basal leaves form a characteristic rosette. The plant is also known to form a taproot. \
    It has an upright growth habit (40 - 100 cm tall) and is generally short lived (annual or biennial). \
    Flowers are yellow to white. Siliqua (fruit) is 1–5 cm long, 3–5 mm wide, markedly constricted between seeds and \
    breaking into 1-seeded portions. Wild radish produces prolific seed quantities (800 per plant) with high longevity and dormancy. \
    Wild radish is a weed of disturbed sites, waste areas, roadsides, crops, pastures, orchards, waterways, floodplains and open woodlands. \
    It has a wide distribution from temperate regions, sub-tropical, semi-arid and sometimes tropical regions. \
    Wild radish tolerates a range of soil types, but has been shown to have a preference for acidic sandy soils. \
    Herbicide resistance has been reported for chlorsulfuron in South Africa and multiple resistance to several \
    herbicide groups in other regions.',
    hosts: 'Wild radish hosts a range of vegetable crop pests and diseases, some of which include thrips, flea beetle, cabbage \
    seedpod weevil, cabbage root fly, several moth species, <em>Fusarium oxysporum</em> f<em>.sp melonis</em>, \
    club root, blackleg, turnip yellow mosaic virus, beet western yellows virus, turnip mosaic virus, cauliflower mosaic \
    virus and cucumber mosaic virus <a href="https://www.une.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/350249/une-weeds-wild-radish.pdf">(Link)</a>. \
    It also hosts a number of bacteria that can act as disease reservoirs in \
    vegetable crops <a href="https://www.une.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/350249/une-weeds-wild-radish.pdf">(Link)</a>. <br>\
    Wild radish is known to be a source of pollen and nectar for honey bees. This weed is highly attractive to honey bees and \
    the native Australian stingless bee (<em>Tetragonula</em>). A range of other bees are known to visit flowers (Discover Life). \
    In addition to honey bees and stingless bees, butterflies and syrphyd flies are also known to visit \
    flowers <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00328588">(Link)</a>',
